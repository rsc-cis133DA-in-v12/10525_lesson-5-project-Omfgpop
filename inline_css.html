        <h2>Generic Font Families</h2>
        <p>Generic Font Families have a similar look and are grouped accordingly. For example, Sans-seruf fonts have no "little swirls" on the ends whereas Serif fonts have these lines. Other Font families include Cursive, fantasy, proportional and monospace fonts.</p>
        <h3>How to use Colors!</h3>
        <p>The simplest way to use color in a webpage is to hexadecimal colors. To do this you need to locate the text you want to change. Using the style attribute with the color CSS property we can change the color. You can also change the color using an accepted color name in place of the hexadecimal color code.<br>
            Example: “&lt;p style="color: #B84128;">Apples&lt;/p>” Would change the word apple to a dark red color within the paragraph. So, would 
            “&lt;p style="color: #darkred;">Apples&lt;/p>”.
